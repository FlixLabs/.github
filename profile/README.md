# FlixLabs

**FlixLabs** is an organization dedicated to creating streamlined tools for managing and monitoring your movie and TV series collections. Currently, we maintain two main repositories:

1. **[flix_webapp](https://github.com/FlixLabs/flix_webapp)**  
   A *frontend-first* application built on Vue 3 and Vite, providing a unified interface for [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) and [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/).  
   - **Optional Backend**: Can be enhanced by integrating [flix_api](https://github.com/FlixLabs/flix_api).  
   - **Features** include movie/TV search, adding/removal, viewing upcoming releases, monitoring downloads, and more.

2. **[flix_api](https://github.com/FlixLabs/flix_api)**  
   A lightweight Node.js API that pairs with **flix_webapp** to unlock advanced features:  
   - **Multi-instance management** for Radarr and Sonarr  
   - **Basic Authentication** for additional security
